# Type Export Tool

This is a simple tool that registered under the Tools -> Utilities menu that allows the user to export all the Gramps attribute, event and other types in the Gramps database.  At the moment it uses a simple json file.

A corresponding Type Import Tool can be used to load the types back into the database.
